        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="content" id="overview">
            <h2 class="pb-3">Context</h2>
            <p>Spotted is a project I completed as a part of the cohort program
                for Brown RISD Innovation Community. Spotted was an app that our project lead had previously 
                created in one of her classes, and the app's purpose was to help users find spots to explore 
                near them by interest, activity, distance, and more. We set out to rework the app's mission and 
                redesign the experience from scratch.

            <p2 class="pb-2">ORIGINAL PROBLEM STATEMENT</p2>
            <p><br>To narrow down a target audience, we decided to redesign the product to appeal to 
            college students. At the beginning of this study, our hypothesis was:</p><br>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">College students want to find places to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">create meaningful experiences</span> with friends and others, 
                        but they can't because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they don't know where to go</span>.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div><br><br>

            
            <p2 class="pb-2">USER SURVEYS</p2>
            <p><br>Through surveys, we asked a random pool of 100+ college age students to answer questions about how well they know their city,
                  what they rely on to find new places to explore, and their experiences with using those methods.
            </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">üëÅÔ∏è Many users felt seeing visuals online increased their chances of exploring 
                            that place.
                        </p><br>
                        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">ü§ù Reviews on rating apps are insignificant and less trustworthy for college 
                            students. People would prefer reviews from personal friends and people of the same age demographic.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">College students find exploring their college cities to be important because 
                        it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">designated time in their life to explore new places</span>. In addition, many students like to explore 
                        new places with friends to give them an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">incentive to spend more time together</span> and socially engage with 
                        one another.
                    </p><br>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Furthermore, people want to find new places to explore, but it's difficult because they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heavily rely on 
                        recommendations by people they know</span> rather than strangers online.

            <p><br>We then began to start drafting some low fidelity wireframes. Each one of our team members 
                focused on a separate feature to wireframe. I was tasked to wireframe some of the profile page

                We then combined our ideas into a single wireframe that we created in Figma. 
                Some of the user experiences we explored were redesigns of the homepage, navigation bar, search function, and review system.

            <br><br>
                    <p>We also created a visual design style guide that documents the main colors and typography to keep our designs 
                        consistent and establish a visual identity as we moved on to the high-fidelity wireframes. We decided to go for a 
                        clean, minimalist look with just one accent color since the app is very image-heavy.

            <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
            <p style="font-weight:500; color:#303030; font-size: 1.3rem;">There were a few key design decisions that we made in this process.</p>
            <br><p2>REDESIGNING HOME</p2><br>
            <br>
            <p>Although we focused our project on creating a personalized review system, we wanted to clean up the 
                user experience from the home page.
            </p>
            <p>One significant change we decided on was <b>removing the search button from the navigation bar</b>. We thought this 
                was redundant and unnecessary because there was already a permanent search bar at the top of the screen. Also,
                we <b>added the distance under each spot</b>, which improves efficiency because the user doesn't have 
                to tap each spot to see how far they are. We also <b>darkened the text at the top</b> so it is more accessible for visually-impaired 
                users. 
            </p>
            <img style="margin:2rem 0;" src="images/spotted/spotted-home-redesign.png">

            <p2>UPLOADING CONTENT</p2><br>
            <br>
            <p>Due to the nature of Spotted being a photo-heavy app, we wanted to give users the ability to <b>upload photos without having to leave a review</b>.
                We decided to go with a <b>toggle button</b> instead of sticky button because it reflected the need of being <b>easy and quick to access</b>.                
            </p>
            <img style="margin:2rem 0;" src="images/spotted/spotted-uploading-content.png">

            <p2>QUALITY REVIEWS</p2><br>
            <br>
            <p>We also spent a lot of time trying to create a review system that was user-friendly but also informative. We chose Option 1 
                because it was <b>less cluttered and more inline with the app‚Äôs overall design aesthetics</b>. Furthermore, Option 2 had redundant 
                information, and had disorganized information hierarchy from the first page to the third.
            </p>
            <img style="margin:2rem 0;" src="images/spotted/spotted-quality-reviews.png">

            <p2>SEARCH</p2><br>
            <br>
            <p>Because our research showed us that users rely heavily on recommendations from peers, we wanted to make Spotted <b>a social platform</b>. 
                So with this in mind, we created a <b>new way to search different categories</b>, which include: top or popular spots and accounts, spots, 
                and accounts. The user has the power to <b>filter their search suggestions</b>. This decision is reflected in Option 2.

                    typography, and components from our style guide. Here are the main highlights of the final design:

                    different types of places using the search bar, from the home page.

                <br>
                <p>Users can also use the top search bar to find spots and filter them by availability, distance, and more. 
                    The map function of the app (found in the bottom navigation) allows users to be able to visually see what 
                    spots are around them and how far or close they are to each spot.

                <p>Users can also filter reviews so that they only see reviews from people they are following. Assuming that 
                    users will follow their friends and maybe influencers, by being able to filter reviews, they can get reviews 
                    from people they trust and find the hottest spots that their friends are raving about. Users can also see the 
                    value, service, and taste very quickly through a bar visual and images taken by other users.

                <p2>REVIEW SYSTEM</p2><br>
                <br>
                <p>our review system was something that we focused a lot on. Through our design, users can quickly and easily 
                    provide quantitative metrics through star ratings and yes/no questions and add qualitative reviews through 
                    tags and writing. This allows for a more holistic, trustworthy, and transparent review system.

                <br>
                <p>We also gave users the ability to save spots and create boards, which essentially group spots into little folders. 
                    We thought this would be helpful to help plan dates or trips with friends or just keep track of favorite spots. 
                    Also, reviews that users have posted are displayed on their profile, so their followers can see where they‚Äôve 
                    been and how they enjoyed those spots.

                <h2 class = "pb-3">Conclusion & Learnings</h2>
                <p>This was the first time I was involved in designing an app idea. I learned a lot about the UI/UX design process and how to work collaboratively 
                    with other designers, and I gained experience working with design tools like Figma. If I had more time,
                    I would conduct more research and usability testing throughout the design process and on final designs. I'd also like to 
                    explore and enhance the social capability of the app by finding ways to incentivize posting reviews and pictures of spots. 
                    I also think the app leans toward being too restaurant-heavy, such that it‚Äôs sort of too much like Yelp. 
                    In the future, I‚Äôd like to think of ways to redefine the app‚Äôs features and mission to focus on exploring 
                    new places with friends.
