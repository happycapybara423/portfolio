            <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>The main goal of this project was to redesign a website to accommodate all screen sizes from desktop,
                     to tablet, to mobile. I chose to redesign the home page for <a href="https://mcl.org/">Mercer County Library System</a>, 
                     the local library I grew up with. As news and media content shift away from print, it will 
                     be increasingly important for libraries to establish a solid digital presence to stay 
                     relevant in the modern age. My redesign of their website, which is outdated and hard to use,
                      aims to bolster community engagement with the library and improve public access to the 
                      library‚Äôs events, resources, and services.

        <!-- Identifying Usability Problems -->

            <h2>Research</h2>
                <p2>IDENTIFYING USABILITY PROBLEMS</p2>
                <p><br>I began my design process by identifying problems with the site‚Äôs usability, 
                    which I broke down into three dimensions:

                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><b>Learnability</b> - Is it easy for new users to learn?</li>
                    <li><b>Memorability</b> - Is it easy for casual users to recall what to do?</li>
                    <li><b>Efficiency</b> - Can frequent users accomplish typical tasks quickly?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The most usable interfaces answer yes to these questions. I began this process by performing a
                    quick walkthrough of the existing web page, jotting down any thoughts, concerns, or questions I
                    had as they arose.
                </p>
                   <img style="padding:4rem 0rem" class="full-width" src="images/mcls/cognitive-walkthru.png" alt="cognitive-walkthrough-of-old-site">  
                <p>At a glance, the webpage was cluttered and unpolished, and I found it difficult to find and perform 
                    specific actions on the page. I then dove into a detailed analysis of the website‚Äôs usability, 
                    keeping in mind the three dimensions as well as the conceptual models that the interface uses 
                    and how they compare to the typical user‚Äôs mental models. I synthesized my findings into a few key problems:
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                
                <div class="container" style="display: flex;">
                    <div style="width: 50%; padding: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">
                        <p><b>üóëÔ∏è &nbsp;Visual clutter & information overload</b></p>
                        <p>Users may be overwhelmed by the large amount of information on the page, 
                            particularly the Resources and Services sections which have many categories.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: 50%; padding: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">
                        <p><b>‚ÑπÔ∏è &nbsp;Lack of contextual information</b></p>
                        <p>The Resources, Services, and Catalog sections lay out all of the available options 
                            without providing any context as to what they‚Äôre about or how to start using them.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Irrelevant or auxiliary information gets more priority than it likely should. 
                            The user‚Äôs mental model might not align with the current structure of content, 
                            so they‚Äôre not finding the answers they want when they want.
                        </p>

                    <div style="width: 50%; padding: 0px 20px 30px 20px;">

                        <p>Many of the typical tasks one would perform, such as searching the library catalog, 
                            registering and looking for information about events, reserving and renewing books, 
                            and applying for a library card are hard to find or complete quickly.

                <!-- Accessibility -->
                <div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p2>ACCESSIBILITY</p2><br><br>
                
                    <p>After identifying usability problems, I also used WebAIM WAVE to detect issues 
                        with accessibility. These were the most significant issues it found:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li> 
                                <b>Many images have null or empty alternative text.</b> 
                                I agree that this could be an issue, as alt text makes 
                                it easier for those using a screen reader to navigate the site.
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                                <b>Many very low contrast errors.</b> 
                                I would disagree here. From my own observations, I didn‚Äôt notice too many 
                                apparent contrast errors, except for the hover states of the digital collection 
                                titles in the catalog section. Also, it seems like the contrast errors they found 
                                did not compare the correct foreground and background colors, creating errors that 
                                didn‚Äôt exist.
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                                <b>ARIA Hidden tags.</b> 
                                Content with these tags were hidden with ARIA and not presented to screen reader users. 
                                I noticed that these tags generally only applied to the social media buttons, so users 
                                with screen readers might not be able to interact with or navigate to the library‚Äôs 
                                social media channels. However, I don‚Äôt think this is a huge area of concern.
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                                <b>Redundant text titles and noscript elements.</b> 
                                WAVE recommended either removing or modifying the title attribute to provide advisory, 
                                not redundant information. This doesn‚Äôt seem too concerning in terms of accessibility. 
                                The noscript elements might not be accessible to users that have disabled scripts, but 
                                since most people do have them enabled, I don‚Äôt think this presents a huge accessibility 
                                issue either.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ultimately, WebAIM WAVE didn't reveal too many accessibility issues that I could address through
                            my redesign of the interface, other than contrast errors.

            <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
                <p2>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</p2><br><br>
                    <p>To address these issues, I started by brainstorming solutions and sketching out
                        low-fidelity wireframes to let me ideate quickly and freely. I also wireframed the page 
                        across a range of screen sizes to implement responsiveness in my design.

            <br><br>
                    <p>I then created a visual design style guide that documents the main colors, typography, and reusable 
                        components‚Äô different states in order to establish a consistent visual identity and facilitate 
                        development.

            <h2>Final Designs</h2>
            <p>I finally translated my low-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity prototypes in Figma using the colors,
                typography, and components from my visual design style guide. Here are the main highlights of the final redesign:
            </p>
            
        </div>

        <!-- hero -->
        <div class="highlights" style="display: flex;">
            <div style="padding: 0 0 0 10rem;">
                <img  src="images/mcls/mcls-hero.png">
            </div>
            <div style="max-width: 30%; padding: 1rem 10rem 0rem 0rem;">
                <p><b>üß≠ &nbsp;Navigational inefficiency</b></p>
                <p>I redesigned the hero and header to <b>make hard-to-find actions visible or more distinct</b>. I added a large search bar
                    in the header for easy access since the old search CTA was not apparent. 'Log in,' 'Hours & Locations,' and 'Help'
                    buttons are distinctly sectioned off at the top for greater visibility, and I added quick links so users can find and
                    complete the most popular actions quickly. Furthermore, there is now a CTA for event registration 
                    so users can register directly from the home page if they choose.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- events -->
        <div class="highlights" style="display: flex;">
            <div style="max-width: 30%; padding: 2rem 4rem 0 10rem;">                
                <p><b>üóÇÔ∏è &nbsp;Unorganized IA / content strategy</b></p>
                <p>In my redesign, I gave the events section <b>higher priority</b>, featuring them earlier on the page 
                    for greater visibility. I also redesigned the events section to include 
                    more imagery and details to give users a better idea of the events at a glance and added a distinct 
                    register CTA for each event. These changes aim to <b>drive engagement</b> with the library by making it easier 
                        for visitors to discover and register for events.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p><b>‚ÑπÔ∏è &nbsp;Lack of contextual information <br>üóëÔ∏è &nbsp;Visual clutter & information overload</b></p>
                <p>The current Resources, Services, and Catalog sections lay out all of the available options 
                   <b> without providing any context</b> as to what they‚Äôre about or how to start using them. Not only does this design 
                    take up a lot of space, but also it is confusing for users to interact with. 
                </p>     
                <p>My redesign groups these similar sections into an <b>"Explore" section</b> for better organization and ease of navigation.
                    I  <b>reallocated unnecessary clutter</b> in these sections to reduce information overload and
                    added a <b>brief description</b> of each so users know what they can use them for and CTAs to visit those pages for more details.
                </p>

                <p>Staff Picks is currently embedded within the Resources section, but it gets lost in all of the visual clutter. I decided to make 
                    Staff Picks its own section to make it easier for users to discover new reads, especially since it is a common reason for people to visit the site.
                    I also added the title and author underneath each book. 
                </p>

                <p>In the current site, the first three cards under the header aren't organized, clear, or consistent 
                    in theme or style, and it's not immediately clear whether they are events, resources, or something else entirely. 
                    To address this issue, I added a "Bulletin" section to <b>create a designated place for notices and community information</b>.
                    Furthermore, I added a <b>"Submit to Bulletin" CTA</b> that allows users to submit their own notices and resources to the Bulletin in order to
                    encourage greater community engagement.
                </p>

                    Mercer County Library‚Äôs redesigned and responsive home page</a>. Given the scope of this project, I used mostly dummy elements to replace navigational elements, 
                    links, and buttons. Moving forward, I hope to incorporate Flexbox and CSS's other layout tools more in my future designs.

            <h2>Conclusion & Learnings</h2>
                <p>Looking back on my childhood, my local library played an integral role in my early education. I took on this project not only because 
                    I thought their website could be improved, but also because I wanted to find a way to give back to an institution that shaped my formative years.

                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges of this project was designing for responsiveness. Understanding the value of responsiveness in providing a 
                    more user-friendly experience across all devices as well as the constraints of development made me a lot more intentional 
                    about the way I approached my designs.
